            TLDR; Indian kid in an Engineering College Dreaming BIG
          </h3>
          <p class="my-3">
            If you're hoping for a gloomy and happy story, I must warn you!
            Better not continue, you might get hurt! It was all in place until
            grade X public exams were about to begin. I felt satisified with my
            preparation and did my exams well enough to earn a 10 pointer. I was
            cloud nine, when my results were out! I was a pretty peaceful phase
            in my life. Little did I know that it was the silence before the
            Tsunami.

          <p class="my-3">
            Just like any Indian kid's life turns into full fledged preparation
            sacrificing family life and social life. Mine didn't turn any
            better! There were days, not once but many, when I couldn't see my
            father although we lived under the same roof. I felt the heat that
            preparing for college isn't going to be easy. Oh yes! It all paid
            off when I scored a perfect score in the 3 SAT Subject Tests - Math
            Level 2, Chemistry and Physics. I was the happiest person on this
            planet when I got my grade XII result of 94.8 %. I assure you that
            you'll never be able to find a happier person than I was. I was
            literally on top of the world. But, other things didn't turn the way
            I wanted them to be. I got rejected in the DASA quota for pool of
            colleges that I had given, mind you that I scored the maximum
            achievable score in those exams and still couldn't get through. For
            those, who found it wague, DASA is like JoSAA for IITs, NITs and
            other central government undertaking colleges, but for
            Non-resdiential Indians. It was one of the darkest phases in my
            life. I was hoping for a light at the end of the road. Let me tell
            you I did apply to two other institutions out of safety for a
            backup, it came in handy, got through at both places. One, the
            mighty Anna University's College of Engineering, and the other is my
            love, SSN College of Engineering. Here, I am today, a proud SSNite!
            I don't regret choosing SSN over CEG even a single day. I just love
            the college's vibe and ambience. And I assure you will do too!
